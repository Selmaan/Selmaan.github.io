My work in the [Aronov Lab](https://www.aronovlab.com) aims to clarify the neural mechanisms underlying episodic-like memory. I characterize the hippocampal representations underlying caching behaviors in black-capped chickadees, using silicon probe recordings, 3D postural tracking, and behavioral modeling.

I did my graduate research in the [Harvey Lab](https://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard, where I developed optical methods to relate cortical network structure to function, and the organization of neural coding underlying navigational decisions.
