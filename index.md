I'm a systems neuroscientist studying the neural mechanisms underlying cognition. I am particularly drawn to dynamic cognitive abilities utilized during natural behavior, such as chickadee food-caching behavior. I like to unlock novel research directions via tool development, with specialties in electrophysiological, optical, behavioral and computational methods.

My lab opens in 2026 at Yale Neuroscience in affiliation with the Wu Tsai Institute. I'll be looking for graduate students, technicians and postdocs to work on these topics — reach out if interested!

I received my PhD from Harvard in the [Harvey lab](https://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu), where I developed an all-optical method ('influence mapping') permitting functional and structural characterization of a neural population. I completed my postdoctoral research with [Dmitriy Aronov](https://www.aronovlab.com) at Columbia, where I pioneered the use of black-capped chickadees as a model system for systems neuroscience.
