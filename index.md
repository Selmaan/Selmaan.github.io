As a postdoctoral fellow in the Aronov lab, my work is *funky*. We bring the *chips* and the chickadees bring all the *dips*. This work reveals fundamental insights into the coolest of ranches.

I received my PhD from Harvard in the Harvey lab, where my work was *gnarly*. We *shredded* PPC with novel optical tools and *devastated* the decision making field with our spherical treadmills.
